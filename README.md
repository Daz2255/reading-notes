A **Growth Mindset*** is believing that success is dependent on time and effort. If you have a growth mindset you feel skills and intelligence can be improved with effort and persistence. You embrace challenges, persist through obstacles, learn from criticism and seek out inspiration in othersâ€™ success.

## My Reminders  

>- Celebrate Growth
>- Mistakes are part of learning
>- Review the success of others
